# ModernCalculato
This is a project I was working on after I started in the world of react native. It is a calculator with a light and dark theme with some functions that you can try if you download it from the link to mediafire that I leave below. I do not upload it to PlayStore because I do not have a developer account on that platform, which prevents me from uploading any application. The code is totally free for anyone who wants to review and / or use it for whatever they want.
